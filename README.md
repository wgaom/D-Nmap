# Compute the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of a given network on $\mathbb{S}^2$

Here, we give a numerical way to compute the index and nullity of triple junction networks on $\mathbb{S}^2$. These related concepts are defined in my paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12653. We could verify that all the embedded stationary triple junction networks on $\mathbb{S}^2$ have index $F-1$ and nullity 3 using our Python code.

## How to use it?

You can clone this repository and run test_networks.py using Python3.

You can design some networks by yourself and compute its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.
